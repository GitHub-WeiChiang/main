職責模式 (Chain of Responsibility Pattern)
=====
* ### Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
* ### 為避免請求發送者與接收者耦合在一起，讓多個物件都有可能接收請求。將這些接收物件連接成一條鏈，並且沿著這條鏈傳遞請求，直到有物件處裡它為止。
